# How It All Works Together

    User Interaction (View)
    Users can view the list of blog posts (post_list.html), click on a post to view its details (post_detail.html), or create a new post (new_post.html).

    Controller Logic
    The BlogController manages the interaction between the user and the data, handling requests to view lists, details, or create posts.

    Model Processing
    The PostModel manages the data, handling the storage and retrieval of blog posts.

    View Update
    The BlogController uses the data from the PostModel to render the appropriate view (list, detail, or form).

    Testing
    The test_post_model.py file ensures that the data logic in the PostModel works correctly.

    # Explanation of the Directory Structure

    app/: Main folder for the applicationâ€™s code.
        controllers/: Contains the blog_controller.py, which handles the logic for displaying posts, creating new posts, etc.
        models/: Contains the post_model.py, which represents the data and logic for blog posts.
        views/: Contains the HTML files that display the blog posts, post details, and the form for creating a new post.

    config/: Contains configuration files, like settings.py.

    tests/: Contains test files to ensure that the blog functionality works correctly.

    static/: Contains static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images.

    templates/: Contains reusable templates, like base.html.

    README.md: Provides an overview of the project.

    requirements.txt: Lists all the dependencies needed to run the project.

    manage.py: A script for managing and running the application.

This MVC setup is straightforward but flexible, allowing you to expand the blog website with new features like editing posts, deleting posts, adding user authentication, etc. The clear separation of concerns (Views, Controllers, and Models) makes the project easy to maintain and scale.
